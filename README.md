# 🧠 LangGraph AI Agents Playground

Welcome to **LangGraph AI Agents**, a minimal but powerful sandbox for experimenting with AI agents built using [LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph/). Whether you're crafting goal-oriented workflows or playing with generative tools like `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`, this repo is a modular testbed for thinking in *graphs, not just chains*.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

- 🧩 Modular agent definitions using LangChain and LangGraph
- 🤖 Integration with `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` and other LLMs
- 🔁 Async execution, memory graphs, multi-agent orchestration
